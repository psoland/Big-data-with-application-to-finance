# Big data with application to finance
Course in big data and machine learning at Norwegian School of Economics (NHH).

## Corse description 

Businesses have entered the age of Big Data. Now that computers and the Internet have become so central to modern commerce, businesses are awash with large amounts of data about their customers. Electronic trading has made handling large amounts of data central to financial firms. Big Data has created both challenges and opportunities. The biggest opportunity is to extract useful information from the masses of data using statistics and machine learning. Businesses that can extract such information and act on it automatically have a substantial competitive advantage. Some of the world's most successful companies, such as Google and Facebook, have built themselves around Big Data.

This course will focus on the analysis of Big Data, and will focus on applications to finance. (We will touch on other application areas as appropriate.) 

Examples of such applications include:

* Automated trading and portfolio management.
* Credit scoring: determining which loans are likely to go bad.
* Catching financial criminals in the act.
* Sales: recommending new financial products to customers.
* This course will take students to the frontier of Big Data analysis. 

Students will learn how to:

* Work with large datasets.
* Fix problems in real-world data to enable analysis.
* Analyze data using the current state-of-the art algorithms for supervised and unsupervised learning.
* Understand and avoid overfitting.
* Apply what they have learned to real data.
